This assignment presented many difficulties. I met regularly with classmates over the week to discuss the different ways to execute the desired functions. Thanks to my tutor teaching me promises early on, I was able to implement async functions with ease. I struggled some with the schema, but thanks to the meet ups, I understand now it's a straightforward process once you memorize the syntax. 

After getting some of the basic outline done, I struggled with random errors but worked through them. I commited more than 20 hours on this assignment and tried to add as much functionality as possible with most, if not all, the bonuses completed. Overall it was a frustrating but fun endeavor.
